# Practical Projects with Keras 2X [eLearning]
Practical Projects with Keras 2.x teaches you various methods and techniques to develop neural networks and deep learning applications using Keras. With this course, you'll be able to build strong fundamentals of Keras in the areas of deep learning and artificial intelligence.

## What you will learn
* Apply regression methods to your data and understand how the regression algorithm works
* Import and organize data for neural network classification analysis
* Solve a regression problem through the least squares algorithm
* Use a classification algorithm to predict the outcome of an event
* Train, test, and deploy a model in Keras environment
* Implement multilayer neural networks in Keras
* Improve the performance of a model by removing outliers

### Hardware requirements
For an optimal learning experience, we recommend the following hardware configuration:
* Processor: Intel Core i5 or equivalent
* Memory: 4GB RAM (8 GB Preferred)
* Storage: 35 GB available space

### Software requirements
You must also install in advance the following software:
* OS: Windows 7 SP1 64-bit, Windows 8.1 64-bit or Windows 10 64-bit, Ubuntu Linux, or the latest version of OS X
* Browser: Google Chrome/Mozilla Firefox Latest Version
* Notepad++/Sublime Text as IDE (Optional, as you can practice everything using Jupyter notebook on your browser)
* Python 3.4+ (latest is Python 3.7) installed (from https://python.org)
* Python libraries as needed (Jupyter, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, BeautifulSoup4, and so)
