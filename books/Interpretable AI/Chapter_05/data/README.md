# Chapter 5 Data

The dataset used in Chapter 5 is the Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC) dataset consisting of 162 whole mount slide images of Breast Cancer (BCa) specimens scanned at 40x. From that, 277,524 patches of size 50 x 50 were extracted (198,738 IDC negative and 78,786 IDC positive). Please download the raw dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/breast-histopathology-images) into the local `data` folder. Since this is a large dataset (>1 GB), you will need to download this manually yourself.
