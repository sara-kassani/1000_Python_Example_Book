# Math and Architectures of Deep Learning

Python code (in the form of Jupyter ipython notebooks) to support the book "**Math and Architectures of Deep Learning**".

Code contributors: **Ananya Ashok, Sujay Narumanchi, Devashish Shankar, Krishnendu Chaudhury**.

This repository contains the example code - mostly in Numpy and PyTorch - corresponding to
the theoretical topics introduced in the book. The code listings are organized in chapters
that correspond to the main book.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/krishnonwork/mathematical-methods-in-deep-learning-ipython.git`
2. Create virtual environment: `virtualenv venv --python=python3` (you may need to do  `pip install virtualenv` first)
3. Activate virtual environment: `source venv/bin/activate` 
4. Change directory: `cd mathematical-methods-in-deep-learning-ipython`
5. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
6. Navigate to the python directory: `cd python`
7. Start jupyter: `jupyter notebook`

This will redirect you to a browser window with the ipython notebooks 

Note: Ensure to use Python3 to run the notebooks
