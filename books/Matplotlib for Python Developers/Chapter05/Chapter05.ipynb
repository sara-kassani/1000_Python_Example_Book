Readers should always refer to the webpage - https://python-gtk-3-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html for the most updated information in installation. By the time this book was written, the official webpage was suggesting to install GTK+3 through jbuild. However, there was a compatability issue with jhbuild with the Mac OS El Capitan. And using the package manager 'brew' seems to serve a better purpose here. \n",
